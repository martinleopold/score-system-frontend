Motion Bank score system frontend
=================================

These files make up the front end of our "online score" system. Under development ... i don't think you want to use it right now.

**Running this locally**

	The front end is a single page application based on [Chaplin.js](http://chaplinjs.org/) and [Backbone.js](http://backbone.js.org/). It requires a back end that serves the actual content through an API:
https://github.com/motionbank/score-system-backend

Copy and rename `config-default.js` to `config.js` (in app/js/config/). Set values for the backend as needed.

Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), we are running v0.8.2 locally.

Install [Brunch](http://brunch.io/):
```
$ npm install -g brunch
```

Now fetch the needed modules and libraries:
```
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

Run brunch:
```
$ brunch w --server # skip the --server option if you have your own
```
Now point your browser to http://localhost:3331/

**Deploy it**

Run brunch once: ```brunch b``` and then upload the contents of ```public/``` to your server.

**Extending the base**

The base of the system lives in ```app-base```, you can extend anything in there by creating another directory called ```app-extend``` next to it. Place any HTML / CSS / JS code in there using the same structure as in ```app-base```. Once brunch is run the contents will be compiled along.
